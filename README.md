# BALL-BEARING-FAULT-DETECTION
Welcome to the Ball Bearing Fault Detection project repository!

This repository contains the code and data for a simple project that intends to serve as Final year Capstone project.<br>
Work presented ranges from preprocessing the Ball Bearing Vibrational Data, training and testing ML models for fault detection, image conversion and then feeding it to Convoluted Neural Networks.

#### Contributing
Contributions from anyone interested in improving the project are welcomed. Whether you have ideas for new models, improvements to existing code, or just want to report a bug, you're encouraged to open an issue or submit a pull request.

#### Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the [Bearing Data Center at Case Western Reserve University](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file) for providing the dataset used in this project.
